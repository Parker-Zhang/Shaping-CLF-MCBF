# Shaping-CLF-MCBF

This repository contains the code corresponding to the paper titled: **Deadlock-Aware Control for Multi-Robot Coordination with Multiple Safety Constraints**. The proposed framework focuses on detecting and avoiding deadlocks in multi-robot systems while ensuring safety and performance through the use of Control Lyapunov Functions (CLFs) and Control Barrier Functions (CBFs).

**Note**: This repository will be made public upon the paper's publication.
