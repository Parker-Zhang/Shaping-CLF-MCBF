# Shaping-CLF-MCBF

This repository contains the code corresponding to the paper titled: **Deadlock-Aware Control for Multi-Robot Coordination with Multiple Safety Constraints**. The proposed framework focuses on detecting and avoiding deadlocks in multi-robot systems while ensuring safety and performance through the use of Control Lyapunov Functions (CLFs) and Control Barrier Functions (CBFs).

**Note**: This repository will be made public upon the paper's publication.

## Features
- **Comparison with Other Methods**: The repository also includes comparisons with three other methods:
  - **LSC**: As proposed in [LSC Paper](#)
  - **RSC**: As proposed in [RSC Paper](https://github.com/PKU-MACDLab/IMPC-OB)
  - **CBF-CD**: As proposed in [CBF-CD Paper](#)

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `qpsolvers`
